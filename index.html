                        One of the aims of this project is representing the current demographics of students and commuting conditions of the York University community. Clustering model is the algorithm considered which is used to identify the community members’ locations and find the transportation routes they can use to commute to YorkU, Keele campus. The clustering model identifies clusters of population in each region of Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and surroundings.

                        Another aim of this project is generating a recommendation map of off-campus housing locations for the students to have a beter quality of life. Multi-criteria decision making is the main structure that is followed. Commuting time from each location, is considered as the main attribute toward a good housing location. Other criteria such as near to shopping centers, food and recreation sites are also considered for analysis. Weights are assigned to all these criteria using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Then, Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is used and a final off-campus housing recommendation map is generated, showing optimal living locations.

                        OIPA York University provides an institutional data hub to the general public for research and metrics. It also provides some useful visualizations as interactive charts which displays criteria based on historical data along with enrollment, retention, research, faculty and staff, physical space and more. Though, interpretations from the visualized data are beneficial but aren’t significant to conduct analysis for the provided amount of data. The interactive dashboard is focused on presenting reports on collected data which is available as processed information and not completely raw. Moreover, parameters are limited and require time-consuming authentication process to look for more detailed insights on data. Hence, meaningful analysis of processed data is more challenging. This project aims to collect and analyze data from the OIPA warehouse and put better visual analysis in terms of demographics, interactive maps, dynamic analysis tools and projections based on processed information. Using data from relative sources of transportation portrays meaningful and concrete results towards the insights on demographics and YorkU community' commute issues.

Initially, methods involve representation of postal codes on the map via geocoding using APIs like Google API and MapQuest, and algorithms to compute cost and time required to travel from each postal code or region to York. This process involves data from transit services to be incorporated. The proposed analysis is extracting potential correlations between distance and the number of students from each region. However, this analysis is helpful to identify which route is critical in terms of commute via public transit, personal or carpool and what factors can affect the services for given conditions.-->

                        Datasets visualized after processing are evaluated with relative APIs to cross analyze the precision of processed results and uncertainties for different evaluations. Since means of travelling could be different based on time of the day or day, thus consideration for the defined criteria of time slots are considered and results are generated based on that. However, analysis can be generalized for possible time slot scenarios as part of future implementations but currently study focuses towards fixed slots. Apart from postal data sets, useful community information are extracted from the OIPA warehouse and raw transportation information from transit services are evaluated along with routing APIs to put forward better results. Major implications are towards the real-time evaluation of time effective and multiple criteria defined for MCDM analysis. Since handling stream data is another challenge so firstly our aim is for building a system that is robust and reliable with given or updated datasets and providing the foundation for supporting future improvements towards more enhanced features.

                        Housing location recommendation map result is evaluated using the real student distribution data. The recommended living areas for new students are presented as blue areas on the map. 
                        It can be observed that in addition to living around the campus, living at Jane and Finch area, the east campus and around Yonge Street areas are also recommended by our algorithm. It can be seen that living around campus areas are recommended based on the advantages of less commuting time. Living around Jane and Finch area, and Yonge Street area are recommended based on advantages of good restaurants around.
